Case Study 1: Basic Git Workflow
Objective: Learn to initialize a repository, make commits, and push changes.
Actions:
-- Initialized a new Git repository using 'git init'.
-- Created a simple "Hello, World!" program in 'HelloWorld.java'.
-- Added changes to the staging area with 'git add HelloWorld.java'.
-- Committed the changes using 'git commit -m "Added HelloWorld.java" '.
-- Pushed the changes to GitHub with 'git push origin main '.
Outcome: Successfully uploaded the initial code to the remote repository.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Objective: Understand how to create branches, add features, and merge them back.
Actions:
-- Created a new branch 'new-feature' with 'git checkout -b new-feature'.
-- Made changes to 'HelloWorld.java'.
-- Committed changes with 'git commit -m "Added new feature" '.
-- Merged changes back into 'main' using 'git checkout main; followed by 'git merge new-feature'.
Outcome: Integrated new-features into the main branch.

Case Study 3: Collaborative Workflow
Objective: Simulate team collaboration with cloning and pull requests.
Actions:
-- Cloned the repository using 'git clone git@github.com:adepushivakumarask/GIT-CASESTUDYS.git'.
-- Created a new branch for features and pushed changes.
-- Created a pull request on GitHub for code review.
Outcome: Practiced collaborative workflows and pull requests.

Case Study 4: Reverting Changes
Objective: Learn to undo changes using revert.
Actions:
-- Made changes in 'HelloWorld.java'.
-- Used 'git revert 426df9284bb0bbf1bbbdc3dfb68f437db79ec363(HEAD)' to undo a specific commit.
-- Pushed the changes back to the repository.
Outcome: Successfully reverted changes and updated the repository.

Case Study 5: Using Git with GitHub Pages
Objective: Practice deploying a static website using GitHub Pages.
Actions:
-- Created an 'index.html' file.
-- Updated the repository settings for GitHub Pages.
-- Pushed the changes to make the website live.
Outcome: Successfully hosted a static website on GitHub Pages.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Case Study 6: Working with Git Tags
Objective: Understand how to use tags for versioning.
Actions:
-- Created tags using 'git tag v1.0' to mark specific commits.
-- Pushed tags to the remote repository using git 'push origin v1.0'.
Outcome: Marked important points in the repository's history.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Case Study 7: Stashing Changes
Objective: Temporarily save changes and apply them after switching branches.
Actions:
-- Used 'git stash' to save changes.
-- Switched branches with 'git checkout -b feature-branch.'
-- Applied stashed changes using 'git stash apply'.
Outcome: Practiced managing uncommitted changes.
